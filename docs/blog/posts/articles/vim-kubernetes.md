    [11 ABSOLUTE ESSENTIAL VIM TIPS FOR CKA, CKAD & CKS EXAM](https://youtu.be/TlyXfEpFvKI?si=mkCZDlIbOikCsUIA)

## Introduction

This article guides you through setting up and managing your test environment for the Kubernetes certification exam. We'll cover essential tips and tricks to streamline your experience.

## Test Environment Overview

The test environment is based on Ubuntu 20, with essential tools like `kubectl`, `yq`, `jq`, `tmux`, and others pre-installed. Understanding these tools is crucial for a smooth exam experience.

### Key Features

- **Browser Terminal**: An Ubuntu 20 terminal accessible in the browser.
- **Lag Management**: Ensure a stable internet connection as the exam platform streams your webcam and screen.
- **Tooling**: Includes `kubectl` with Bash autocompletion, `yq`, `jq`, `tmux`, `curl`, `wget`, and more.

## Exam Interface and Utilities

### PSI Bridge

- **PSI Secure Browser**: Downloadable on major browsers; required for the exam.
- **Single Monitor**: Only one monitor is allowed.
- **Enhanced ExamUI**: Features remote desktop, a countdown timer, and an improved content panel.

### Browser Terminal Setup

Spend the initial minute setting up your terminal. Most questions will be handled in the main terminal, with occasional SSH into other machines.

#### Minimal Setup

- **Aliases**: `kubectl` alias (`k`) and autocompletion are pre-configured.
- **Vim Configurations**: The `.vimrc` file includes settings like `set tabstop=2`, `set expandtab`, and `set shiftwidth=2`.

#### Optional Setup

- **Dry-run Output**: `export do="--dry-run=client -o yaml"`
- **Fast Pod Deletion**: `export now="--force --grace-period 0"`
- **Persistent Bash Settings**: Store settings in `~/.bashrc` for multi-shell usage.

### Alias Namespace

Create an alias for namespace switching:

```bash
alias kn='kubectl config set-context --current --namespace '
```

Use it as `kn default` or `kn my-namespace`.

## Exam Tips

- Utilize the `history` command and `Ctrl + r` for faster command retrieval.
- Manage long-running tasks with `Ctrl + z` and `fg`.
- Use `k delete pod x --grace-period 0 --force` or `k delete pod x $now` for rapid pod deletion.

## Vim Mastery

- **Toggle Line Numbers**: In Vim, use `:set number` or `:set nonumber`.
- **Copy/Paste in Vim**: Use `Esc + V` to mark, `y` to copy, `d` to cut, and `p` or `P` to paste.
- **Indent Multiple Lines**: Set `shiftwidth=2`, mark lines with `Shift + v`, and use `>` or `<` to indent.

## Conclusion

Preparing and managing your test environment effectively can greatly enhance your performance in the Kubernetes certification exam. Good luck!
