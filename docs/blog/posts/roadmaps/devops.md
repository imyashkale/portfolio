Explore the essential technologies and practices in the world of DevOps with this roadmap. Whether you're new to DevOps or looking to enhance your skills, this guide will help you navigate key concepts such as version control, continuous integration, containerization, and more.

!!! warning "Important Note"
    This roadmap outlines the key technologies. While it specifies the technologies you should be aware of, it does not detail the specific aspects of each technology that you need to learn. It's important to delve deeper into each technology to understand its intricacies and how it fits into the DevOps ecosystem. Use this roadmap as a guide to explore further and tailor your learning journey to your specific goals and interests.

!!! danger "Important Note for Your DevOps Journey"
    While having a deep understanding of one technology from a category (e.g., AWS) is crucial, having a basic understanding of similar technologies (e.g., Azure) can be beneficial but is not mandatory. Focus on mastering one technology to excel in your field, but remain open to exploring others to broaden your knowledge.
