#### Overview

Creating a Dockerfile for a Go application involves defining steps to build a lightweight and efficient Docker image. This includes setting up the Go environment, managing dependencies, and preparing the application for deployment.

!!! info "Documentation"
    [Dockerizing a Go application](https://docs.docker.com/language/golang/build-images/){:target="_blank"}.

#### Example Dockerfile for Go

This example illustrates a basic Dockerfile setup for a Go application.

```Dockerfile
# Start from a Debian-based Go image
FROM golang:1.16-buster

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the Go Modules manifests
COPY go.mod go.sum ./

# Download Go modules
RUN go mod download

# Copy the go source files
COPY *.go ./

# Compile the application
RUN go build -o /myapp

# Command to run the executable
CMD ["/myapp"]
```

#### Steps to Create a Dockerfile for Go

1 **Select the Base Image**

- Use a Go base image like `golang:1.16-buster`.  

2 **Define Working Directory**

- Set the working directory with `WORKDIR /app`.

3 **Handle Dependencies**

- Copy `go.mod` and `go.sum` and run `go mod download`.

4 **Copy Source Files**

- Copy your Go source files into the container.

5 **Build the Application**

- Compile your app with `RUN go build -o /myapp`.

6 **Specify the Runtime Command**

- Define the command to run the application using `CMD ["/myapp"]`.  

#### Integration with Kubernetes

- Deploying the Go application in Kubernetes requires building the Docker image and defining Kubernetes resources like Deployments or Services.
- Custom Resources can be used to manage application deployment and configurations in Kubernetes, providing a flexible and dynamic deployment mechanism.

#### Conclusion

A Dockerfile for a Go application sets up the necessary environment for running Go applications in containers. This setup facilitates easy deployment and scaling within a Kubernetes cluster, leveraging the power of containerization and orchestration.
