## 1. Memory Management

## Basics of Memory Management

**Definition**: Memory Management is an essential function of the operating system that manages primary memory. It tracks each byte in a computer's memory and maintains the status of allocation and deallocation of memory blocks.

**Key Points**:

- **Allocation Techniques**: The OS allocates memory blocks to processes from the available memory pool.
- **Efficient Utilization**: Ensures efficient utilization of memory and avoids scenarios like underuse or overuse.

## Virtual Memory

**Definition**: Virtual memory is a technique that allows the execution of processes that may not be completely in memory. One major advantage of this scheme is that programs can be larger than physical memory.

**Key Points**:

- **Paging and Swapping**: Virtual memory uses disk paging and swapping to extend the usable memory.
- **Memory Mapping**: It involves mapping virtual addresses to physical addresses, allowing non-contiguous memory allocation, thus minimizing issues of fragmented memory.

## Paging and Segmentation

### Paging

**Definition**: Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory.

**Key Points**:

- **Page Table**: It maps logical addresses to physical addresses, dividing the memory into fixed-size blocks.
- **Advantages**: Simplifies memory allocation and eliminates external fragmentation.

### Segmentation

**Definition**: Segmentation is a memory management technique where the memory is divided into variable-sized segments.

**Key Points**:

- **Logical Division**: Each segment represents a logical division like a function, array, or data structure.
- **Segment Table**: It stores information about each segment, like its starting address and length.

## Memory Allocation

### Static

**Definition**: Static memory allocation is the allocation of memory at compile time before the associated program is executed.

**Key Points**:
