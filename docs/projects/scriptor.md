!!! warning "In the Planning Phase"
    Scriptor is an idea in its infancy, conceptualized from firsthand developer frustrations and currently in the planning stages.

!!! info "Born from Developer Frustration"
    Scriptor, born out of the real-world frustrations of handling script management, is actively being developed to address these challenges.

As a developer, I often found myself bogged down by the tedious task of cloning and managing a plethora of scripts. The constant changes in paths and the manual effort required were not only time-consuming but also a source of frustration. This led to the conceptualization of Scriptor - a tool designed to eliminate these pain points.

Scriptor is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that simplifies the process of managing and executing shell scripts from GitHub repositories. It's created with the intention to save time and reduce the hassle involved in script management, particularly when dealing with multiple repositories and changing file paths.

## Key Features

Scriptor is equipped with several intuitive commands to enhance your script management experience:

### 1. scriptor repo add

Add a GitHub repository with ease:

```bash
scriptor repo add [repo-name]
```

This command clones the specified repository, making all scripts within it easily accessible and runnable from your local environment.

### 2. scriptor repo update

Stay updated effortlessly:

```bash
scriptor repo update
```

Fetch the latest changes from your added repositories to ensure you're working with the most current script versions.

### 3. scriptor [foldername] [scriptname]

Run scripts without hassle:

```bash
scriptor [foldername] [scriptname]
```

Execute a specific script from a designated folder in the cloned repository, without worrying about changing paths or execution permissions.

### 4. scriptor help
