    MicroForge is currently under active development and not yet available for public use. Stay tuned for updates!

MicroForge is a command-line utility designed to streamline the process of creating and managing microservices. It offers a suite of tools to rapidly set up, configure, and prepare microservices for deployment.

## Key Features

MicroForge introduces three core commands:

### 1. microforge init

This command initializes a new microservice project, allowing you to specify the service name, database configuration, and the port number for the service.

```bash
microforge init --name [service-name] --db [database-type] --port [port-number]
```

It creates a base project structure, sets up database configurations as per the specified database type (like MySQL, MongoDB, etc.), and prepares the service to run on the specified port.

### 2. microforge dockerize

Need to regenerate your Dockerfile? This command has you covered:

```bash
microforge dockerize
```

It generates or regenerates a Dockerfile for the current microservice. This includes all necessary instructions for containerization, ensuring your microservice is ready for deployment in a Docker environment.

### 3. microforge help

For assistance with commands or to learn more about MicroForge's capabilities, the help command provides all the information you need.

```bash
microforge help
```

This command displays help and usage instructions for all available MicroForge commands, making it easy to understand and utilize the full potential of the tool.
