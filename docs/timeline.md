    I started college in 2017 and completed two years.
    However, due to a backlog, I took a gap year. During this time,
    I started working at SimSol Technologies in 2019 to make the most of my year off.
    When the pandemic began, it allowed me to continue working while also completing my education online. I finished my degree in 2022.
    After graduating, I joined SRS Business Solutions,
    and later, I transitioned to working at Relanto Global.
